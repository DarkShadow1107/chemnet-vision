ExperimentID,Modification,Accuracy,F1-Score,TrainingTime,Remarks
Exp1,Baseline (2000 samples),0.45,0.38,2 min,Significant hallucinations (everything is 859.14)
Exp2,Full Dataset (42k molecules),0.72,0.68,15 min,Better coverage but still some character duplication
Exp3,Full Dataset + RDKit Weights,0.76,0.72,18 min,Accurate weights for large molecules/proteins
Exp4,Hybrid Lookup + RAG + AI (Optimized),0.85,0.82,20 min,BEST - zero hallucinations for known DB molecules
